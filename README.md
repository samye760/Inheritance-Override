# Inheritance + Override

These are a few [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming) to test [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) and [method overriding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding) in [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). 

The [superclass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#Subclasses_and_superclasses) is a vehicle class with a car and bike [subclasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#Subclasses_and_superclasses) which [override](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding) some of the vehicle's methods, including the equality and toString Object methods.
